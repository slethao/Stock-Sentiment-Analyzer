## <span style="color:#F3B8B1"> My Thoughts on TensorFlow
*My initial approach for the preparation to create the Stock Analyzer with TensorFlow was to follow the official documentation.  Unfortunately, I encountered numerous execution problems due to outdated code examples.  This necessitated extensive research on GitHub and within the TensorFlow community forums to find solutions*
