# <span style="color:#F3D2AC">Getting Started with TensorFlow</span>
*Crash course on how to learn TensorFlow.*
## <span style="color:#F3B8B1"> My Thoughts on TensorFlow
*My initial approach for the preparation to create the Stock Analyzer with TensorFlow was to follow the official documentation.  Unfortunately, I encountered numerous execution problems due to outdated code examples.  This necessitated extensive research on GitHub and within the TensorFlow community forums to find solutions*

This part of the reposity is my testing and experimenting with the documation examples and finding out what works, so you don't have to!
| Lessons | Description|
| --- | --- |
| <span style="color:#7DC8CA">lesson_one.py</span> | This file will allow the programmer to see the steps of how the machine learning model will be built and executed in a non-object oriented way. |
| <span style="color:#7DC8CA">lesson_two.py</span> | This file shows is an extension of <code>lesson_one.py</code> that will show the programmer how to use an optimizer in their machine learning model along with using the decorator <code>@tensorflow.function</code> |
| <span style="color:#7DC8CA">lesson_three.py</span> | This file will show you how to build and execute and machine learning model through a class and includes how to create a personalized training method for the model. |
